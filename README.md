Here I will store some [API](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+api&oq=what+is+api) code 

Something like:
* FACEBOOK API
* YOUTUBE API
* TIK TOK API
* BLA BLA API 

## but first some APIs run manually and others have to run automatically

# setup:
## Handmade 
* it is quite simple to run it manually, you just need to register on the developer page of the service you want to use the API Like [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com) or [google](https://developers.google.com)
* This item is quite simple, you just need to use localhost or hosting to use it 
* But if that API has to be implemented continuously, Then we can't monitor continuously
## Automatic
* ....
